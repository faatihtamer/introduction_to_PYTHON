# Introduction to Python Programming LiveLessons
This is the code for **Introduction to Python Programming LiveLessons**: *Learn How to Program Today with Python* by Arianne Dee

To get started with this course, please follow these instructions:
1. [Install Python](#1-install-python-36-or-higher)
2. [Install PyCharm](#2-download-pycharm-community-edition)
3. [Download the code](#3-download-the-course-files)
4. [Check that Python was installed properly](#4-make-sure-that-python-is-properly-installed)

## Set up instructions
### 1. Install Python 3.6 or higher
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/

Click the yellow button at the top to download the latest version of Python.

#### On Mac or Linux
Follow the prompts and install using the default settings.

#### On Windows
The default settings don't add Python to your PATH 
so your computer doesn't know where to look for it when Python runs 
(for some inexplicable reason).

##### If you're just installing Python now
Follow the instructions here: [Windows Python installer instructions](docs/WININSTALL.md)

##### If you've already installed Python with the default settings
Follow the instructions here: [Add Python to PATH variable in Windows](docs/WINSETPATH.md)

### 2. Download PyCharm (Community Edition)
Download here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Install, open, and use the default settings.

### 3. Download the course files
If you're viewing this on GitHub already, stay on this page.
Otherwise, go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ariannedee/intro-to-python

#### If you know git:
Clone the repository.

#### If you don't know git:
1. Click the green "Clone or download" button on the top-right of the page
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Unzip it
4. Move the **intro-to-python-livelessons-master** folder to a convenient location

### 4. Make sure that Python is properly installed
1. Open the *Command Prompt* application in Windows
or *Terminal* on Mac or Linux

1. Type `python --version` and press enter

1. Type `python3 --version` and press enter

1. One or both of those commands should print 
a Python version of 3.7.1 or higher 
(whichever version you just downloaded)

**Note:** 
You can now type just the `python` or `python3` command
in *Command Prompt* or *Terminal* 
to run the Python interpreter.
You can also run a *.py* file by running 
`python filename.py`
